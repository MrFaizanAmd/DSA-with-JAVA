# ➕ Add Two Numbers

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return their **sum**.

> In some variations (like LeetCode #2), `a` and `b` are represented as **linked lists**.  
> But in this basic version, they are normal integers.

---

## 📥 Input
- Two integers: `a`, `b`  
  Constraints: `-10^9 <= a, b <= 10^9`

## 📤 Output
- An integer: `a + b`

---

## 🔍 Examples

| Input     | Output |
|-----------|--------|
| `a = 2`, `b = 3`   | `5`     |
| `a = -4`, `b = 9`  | `5`     |
| `a = 1000`, `b = 2000` | `3000` |

## ✅ Logic / Approach

- Simply return the sum using `+` operator.
- No special edge case handling needed unless dealing with overflow (very large numbers).
